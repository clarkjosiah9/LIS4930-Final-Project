# LIS4930-Final-Project
Final Project for LIS4930

Research Question: “Where are the National Center for Education NAEP’s Mathematics Scale Scores currently trending?”
Method of Solution: Linear Regression, Quadratic Regression to visualize the data and form conclusions.

Objectives: 
  1. Create modules that allow for one to quickly make lines/quadratics of best fit for a given pandas dataframe.
  2.  Read the excel spreadsheet provided by the NCES via pandas and:
  3.  
      a. Graph the line/quadratic of best fit for the average scores of 4th and 8th grade students
      
      b. Graph the line/quadratic of best for for the vaerage scores of economically (dis)advantaged 4th and 8th grade students
      
  4. Make Observations concerning the positive/negative trend of the data as well as the strength of the correlation to its line/quadratic of best fit.
Similar Work: NCES posts regular data visualizations of certain aspects of their data.
