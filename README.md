# LIS4930-Final-Project
Final Project for LIS4930

Research Question: “Where are the National Center for Education NAEP’s Mathematics Scale Scores currently trending?”
Method of Solution: Linear Regression, Quadratic Regression to visualize the data and form conclusions.

Objectives: 
  1. Create modules that allow for one to quickly make lines/quadratics of best fit for a given pandas dataframe.
  2.  Read the excel spreadsheet provided by the NCES via pandas and investigate the data to find which graph gives the strongest correlation.
Similar Work: NCES posts regular data visualizations of certain aspects of their data.
